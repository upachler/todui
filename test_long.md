* [ ] This is a very long todo item that should definitely wrap around when displayed in a narrow terminal window because it contains way more text than can fit on a single line
* [x] Short item
* [ ] Another extremely long todo item with lots of text that goes on and on and should wrap nicely across multiple lines when the terminal width is limited, demonstrating the word wrapping functionality
  * [ ] This is a nested item with very long text that should also wrap properly while maintaining the correct indentation level so that it looks good in the terminal interface
  * [x] Short nested item
  * [ ] Yet another nested item with an incredibly long description that contains many words and should demonstrate how the wrapping works with indented items and how the continuation lines are properly aligned
* [ ] Final item with moderate length text that might wrap
